## Project Ideas
<br>

|  | ♟️ CHESS ♟️ |
| :----: | :---: |
| 01 | Build a multiplayer chess game like https://chess.com |
| 02 | Frontend should allow users to signup, create accounts and create a room |
| 03 | On room creation, they can share the link with their friend who can join the group as well
| 04 | Add move validation to make sure users can only make valid moves
| 05 | Use either canvas or raw HTML blocks for the game. You may also use a game engine like phaser. |
| 06 | You will need to do socket programming since this is a realtime game. |

<br> 

|  | 🐤 MULTIPLAYER FLAPPY BIRD GAME 🐤 |
| :----: | :---: |
| 01 | Create a multiplayer flappy bird game where users can invite their friends and play against each other |
| 02 | Use raw canvas for rendering, and write all physics yourself (Basic physics like acc, velocity ...) |
| 03 | You will need to do socket programming since this is a realtime game. Sockets would relay the positions of users to each other. |

<br>
<br>

|  | 🤖 CREATE A UI ON TOP OF CHAT-GPT API 🤖 |
| :----: | :---: |
| 01 | Create a ChatGPT clone using their APIs |
| 02 | Use their APIs on the backend, relay the information to your frontend |
| 03 | Make sure your frontend experience is 10x better than the native chat GPT experience. |
| 04 | Allow users to put in their own Chat GPT API keys and use GPT 4. |

|  | 🔗 CREATE A MULTICHAIN AIRDROPPING WEBSITE 🔗 |
 :----: | :---: |
| 01 | Build a website that lets users airdrop various crypto currencies to them on their respective testnets |
| 02 | User should be allowed to select the chain (ETH, SOL, Polygon, ARB) and put in an address where they want the native token sent |
| 03 | User should be able to select the amount they want to  |
