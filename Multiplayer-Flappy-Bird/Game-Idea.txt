Here are some additional ideas we could consider for the multiplayer flappy bird game project:

1. Implement power-ups that players can collect during the game, such as invincibility or speed boosts.
2. Add different game modes, such as time trials or obstacle courses.
3. Allow players to customize their bird's appearance and abilities.
4. Integrate social features like leaderboards, in-game chat, and the ability to share game highlights on social media.
5. Implement machine learning algorithms to dynamically adjust the game's difficulty based on each player's skill level.
6. Add sound effects and background music to enhance the overall game experience.
7. Implement different bird characters with unique abilities, such as a bird that can dive underwater or a bird that can shoot projectiles to destroy obstacles.
8. Implement different obstacle types, such as moving obstacles or obstacles that can be destroyed by the player's bird.
9. Integrate ads or in-game purchases to monetize the game.
10. Add support for multiple languages to make the game accessible to players around the world.
As soon as 90% of the level is over, the remaining 10% should have a boss of that level.
This Boss Will Also Bring Extra Abilities With Level Up.
